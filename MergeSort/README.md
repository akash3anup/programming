# Merge Sort

The goal in this code problem is to implement the merge sort algorithm.

Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
- Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
- Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

### Merge Sort overview -
- Worst complexity: n*log(n)
- Average complexity: n*log(n)
- Best complexity: n*log(n)
- Space complexity: n
- Method: Merging
- Stable: Yes

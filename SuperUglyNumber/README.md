# Super Ugly Numbers

Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all prime factors are in the given prime list. Given a number n, the task is to find the nth Super Ugly number.
It may be assumed that a given set of primes is sorted. Also, the first Super Ugly number is 1 by convention.

### Example1

```sh
Input  : primes[] = [2, 5]
         n = 5
Output : 8
Super Ugly numbers with given prime factors 
are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, ...
Fifth Super Ugly number is 8
```
### Example2

```sh
Input  : primes[] = [2, 3, 5]
         n = 50
Output : 243
```
### Example3

```sh
Input : primes[] = [3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
        n = 9

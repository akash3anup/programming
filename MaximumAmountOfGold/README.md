# Maximum Amount of Gold

You are given a set of bars of gold and your goal is to take as much gold as possible into
your bag. There is just one copy of each bar and for each bar you can either take it or not
(hence you cannot take a fraction of a bar).

Given 𝑛 gold bars, find the maximum weight of gold that fits into a bag of capacity 𝑊 .

### Example 1
```sh
Input: W = 10, w = [1, 4, 8]
Output: 9
```

# Disjoint Set (Or Union-Find) | (Detect Cycle in an Undirected Graph)

A disjoint-set data structure is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.

The application disjoint-set data structure is to check whether a given graph contains a cycle or not.
Union-Find Algorithm can be used to check whether an undirected graph contains cycle or not.

A union-find algorithm is an algorithm that performs two useful operations on such a data structure:
- Find: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.
- Union: Join two subsets into a single subset.
